# Contra-Lua.
--Genetic algorithm implemented using lua and bizhawk to play classic contra retro game--

The goal of this project is to test my understanding of the NEAT algorithm. I got very heavy inspiration from sethblings MAR/IO video and code on NEAT algorithms alongside a
number of research papers which I am currently looking into and will list/credit in this read me.

# Roadmap part 1.

1) Get to grips with Lua programming language **DONE**
2) Understand how to use TAS and Bizhawk to extract game information **DONE**
3) Extract game data including player health, locations, enemy status **DONE**
4) In conjunction with looking at research papers and seth blings code, rework and understand the code to fit the solution of my current problem **DONE**


# Roadmap part 2.

1) Create connection gene structures **DONE**
2) Create node gene structure **DONE**
3) Create sample network **DONE**
4) Create mutation functions **DONE**
5) Test mutation functions **DONE**
6) Test network with mutation functions **DONE**
7) Create crossover functions **DONE**
8) Test crossover functions **DONE**
9) Test crossover, mutation and networ functions **DONE**
10) Create species function.
11) Test species function.
12) Create fitness calculation functions
13) Test fitness calculation functions
14) Run and evaluate sample generation
15) Official test run in game
