# Contra-Lua.
--Genetic algorithm implemented using lua and bizhawk to play classic contra retro game--

The goal of this project is to test my understanding of the NEAT algorithm. I got very heavy inspiration from sethblings MAR/IO video and code on NEAT algorithms alongside a
number of research papers which I am currently looking into and will list/credit in this read me.

# Roadmap.

1) Get to grips with Lua programming language (done)
2) Understand how to use TAS and Bizhawk to extract game information (done)
3) Extract game data including player health, locations, enemy status (done)
4) In conjunction with looking at research papers and seth blings code, rework and understand the code to fit the solution of my current problem (in progress)
